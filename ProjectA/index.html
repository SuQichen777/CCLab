          The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus
          Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest
          ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one
          species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently,
          researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due
          to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as
          morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are
          known from the fossil record. (This is from Wikipedia, write the
          story, history, facts, tales, myths, anecdotes about your creature.)
